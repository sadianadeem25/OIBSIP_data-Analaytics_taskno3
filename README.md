# 🧹 Data Cleaning Project

## 📌 Project Overview
Data cleaning is the process of **fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, duplicate, or incomplete data** within a dataset.  
Since **messy data leads to unreliable outcomes**, cleaning is a critical step in any data science or machine learning workflow.  

This project demonstrates **data cleaning techniques** using real-world datasets.

## ⚙️ Key Concepts & Challenges
1. **Data Integrity** – ensuring accuracy, consistency, and reliability  
2. **Missing Data Handling** – imputing or managing gaps effectively  
3. **Duplicate Removal** – maintaining dataset uniqueness  
4. **Standardization** – consistent formatting and units  
5. **Outlier Detection** – identifying & treating skewed values  

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Develop **practical data cleaning skills** for real datasets  
- Understand techniques for handling **missing, duplicate, and inconsistent data**  
- Gain experience in preparing clean data for **EDA & ML models**  

---

## 📊 Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for outlier visualization)  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 📈 Results & Insights
- Reduced dataset inconsistencies by handling missing values  
- Improved reliability by removing duplicates & outliers  
- Produced a **clean, standardized dataset** ready for analysis
